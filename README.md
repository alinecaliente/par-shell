<b><font size="30">PAR-SHELL</font></b>

The application enables the execution and monitoring of batch programs in a multi-core machine. <br>
<br>
Users can run a limited number (defined by its user) of programs in parallel, defined in a txt file (input.txt) with their arguments. The output will be presented through a txt file whose name will be the id of the executing process.<br>
<br>
Par-shell uses pipes to receive commands of different remote terminals, or the command "stats", which will present the actual number of processes running on the machine and the total time of execution.<br>
